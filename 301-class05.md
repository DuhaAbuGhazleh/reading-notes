# Putting it all together

- How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?

The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names. If you’re working with a designer, they may have already done this, so go talk to them! Their Photoshop layer names may end up being the names of your React components!




- What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

- What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

It’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. 


- Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
- What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?


1- Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.

2- Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.

3- Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

- How can you identify where state needs to live?

For each piece of state in your application:

Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
Let’s run through this strategy for our application:

ProductTable needs to filter the product list based on state and SearchBar needs to display the search text and checked state.
The common owner component is FilterableProductTable.
It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in FilterableProductTable
Cool, so we’ve decided that our state lives in FilterableProductTable. First, add an instance property this.state = {filterText: '', inStockOnly: false} to FilterableProductTable’s constructor to reflect the initial state of your application. Then, pass filterText and inStockOnly to ProductTable and SearchBar as a prop. Finally, use these props to filter the rows in ProductTable and set the values of the form fields in SearchBar.

You can start seeing how your application will behave: set filterText to "ball" and refresh your app. You’ll see that the data table is updated correctly.
