# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Consider the history: 

[That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)


- What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?

personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers



- Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

personal computers weren't much more than toys



## Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies
- What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

   * Amazon
   * Apple
    * FaceBook

Ask the question:

-  Why diversity matters to your tech company

different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it


- When are diversity efforts most successful?
- Why do diverse companies perform better?

it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes


- Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups
