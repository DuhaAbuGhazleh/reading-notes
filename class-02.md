## 2- Introducing CSS

- CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements.

- CSS has two parts 

   1- Selector: specify the
elements the rule applies to

   2- Declaration : indicate what elements should look like

  Has two  parts:

   *  Properties of the element that you want to change
   *  Value of those properties.

## 3-JavaScript 

**Instructions**

* A script:  is a series of instructions .
* A statment: Each individual instruction or step and should end with a semicolon.
* A comments:  explain what your code does.
* A variables: temporarily store of information
   HOW to Declare 

` VAR  QUANTITY;`

  
   How to assign 



    `QUANTITY = 3 ;


* Arrays : special types of variables it stores a list of values.

* An expression: evaluates into (results in) a single value

**SWITCH STATEMENTS**


A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value.


* You have a default option that is run if
none of the cases match.

* If a match is found, that code is run; then
the break statement stops the rest of
the switch statement running (providing
better performance than multiple i f
statements).
