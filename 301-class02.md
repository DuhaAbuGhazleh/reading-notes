 ## React State Vs Props
- What types of things can you pass in the props?
- What is the big difference between props and state?


 State is handled inside of that component  and you can update it inside the component 
 
  props are handled outside of the component and must be updated outside

Anothe thing is when you change the state  inside of your application it is going tr re-render that section of your application but props you can not actually change them , you need to change them outside the component 

- When do we re-render our application?

 when you change the state  inside of your application it is going tr re-render that section of your application 


- What are some examples of things that we could store in state?


State store what they are updating that value to and what they are changing that value to. 

like input element , check box , select box and any thing updating by user
