# Passing Functions as Props

## React Docs - lists and keys
- What does .map() return?

returned value is added to newArray


- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in - - JSX, how do I do that in React?

You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.

Below, we loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript map() function. We return a <li> element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to listItems

- Each list item needs a unique key.
- What is the purpose of a key?

help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed

## The Spread Operator
- What is the spread operator?

JavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.


- List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
  * Copying an array
  * Concatenating or combining arrays
  * Using Math functions
  * Using an array as arguments
  * Adding an item to a list
  * Adding to state in React


- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.


const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`] <br>
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`] <br>
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]<br>
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩

- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌'] <br>
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]<br>
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]

- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine objects into one.

const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"} <br>
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"} <br>
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}<br>
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }<br>
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}<br>
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
