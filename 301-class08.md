# APIs

## API Design Best Practices
1. What does REST stand for?

REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia.


2. REST APIs are designed around a resources
.
3. What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.

which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:

https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

4. What are the most common HTTP verbs?

REST APIs use a uniform interface, which helps to decouple the client and service implementations. For REST APIs built on HTTP, the uniform interface includes using standard HTTP verbs to perform operations on resources. The most common operations are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.


5. What should the URIs be based on?
Give an example of a good URI.

Each time you modify the web API or change the schema of resources, you add a version number to the URI for each resource. The previously existing URIs should continue to operate as before, returning resources that conform to their original schema.

Extending the previous example, if the address field is restructured into subfields containing each constituent part of the address (such as streetAddress, city, state, and zipCode), this version of the resource could be exposed through a URI containing a version number, such as https://adventure-works.com/v2/customers/3



6. What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
7. What status code does a successful GET request return?

A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK)


8. What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?

If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).


9. What status code does a successful POST request return?

returns HTTP status code 201 (Created).


10. What status code does a successful DELETE request return?

delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content), indicating that the process has been successfully handled, but that the response body contains no further information. If the resource doesn't exist, the web server can return HTTP 404 (Not Found).
