# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

## Functional Programming Concepts
- What is functional programming?

is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia




- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

The first fundamental concept we learn when we want to understand functional programming is pure functions. 

*It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)

*It does not cause any observable side effects



- What are the benefits of a pure function?

The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:
Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value


- What is immutability?

When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.


- What is Referential transparency?


Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency


## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()


- What is a module?

is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js application.

Each module in Node.js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope. Also, each module can be placed in a separate .js file under a separate folder.

- What does the word ‘require’ do?

In order to use Node.js core or NPM modules, you first need to import it using require() function as shown below.

var module = require('module_name');
