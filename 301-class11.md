# Mongo and Mongoose


|SQL |  NoSQL |
| ------------ | -------------|
| SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases  | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database|
| table based databases |document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
| SQL databases have predefined schema  | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.|
| SQL databases are vertically scalable  |  NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable|
| SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware  | NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load|


1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment


Give a real world example.

MySQL Community Edition MySQL database is very popular open-source database. It is generally been stacked with apache and PHP, although it can be also stacked with nginx and server side javascripting using Node js


2. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

for the hierarchical data storage


3. Give a real world example.

MongoDB


4. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL databases


5. Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL databases becuase are vertically scalable we can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server

## sql vs nosql

1. What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language


2. What is a realational database?

type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another,and enabled users to manage predefined data relationships across multiple databases


3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

Logical Data Structure


4. What is a ‘schema’?

the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed


5. What is a NoSQL database?

is a structure for database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases


6. How does it work?

NoSQL is particularly useful for storing unstructured data, which is growing far more rapidly than structured data and does not fit the relational schemas of RDBMS


7. What is inside of a Mongo database?

MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.


8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB is more flexible becuase it is ensures high and diverse data availability


9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability.
