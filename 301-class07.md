# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother
- Who is Roy Fielding?

He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.


- Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when - we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

 HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

Web pages usually have images, right? Those are separate resources. The web page just specifies the URLs to the images and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. But the important thing here is that very different kinds of nouns can be treated the same. Whether the noun is an image, text, video, an mp3, a slideshow, whatever. I can GET all of those things the same way given a URL.


- What does a GET do?

 Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET

- What does a POST do?

If one system needs to add something to another system


- What does PUT do?

 If a system wants to replace something in another system


- What does PATCH do?

to do a partial update, it'll hopefully 



## API Keys

Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.
