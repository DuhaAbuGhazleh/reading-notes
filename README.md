# Introduction
I am Duha Iam 28 years old I have degree in electrical power engineering

I have to develop myself through perseverance and effort, and the best way to succeed at any work is to  think about the growth mindset. When Iâ€™m ready, I walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward. Just as I should not look at difficulties, I should look at the result we seek. And I must have high level of motivation.
