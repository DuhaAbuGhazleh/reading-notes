# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

## 1- Lists

HTML provides us with
three different types:


-  Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. 


The ordered list is created with
the` <ol>` element.

Each item in the list is placed
between an opening `<li>` tag
and a closing` </li> `tag. 

-  Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point

The unordered list is created
with the` <ul>` element.

-  Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

The definition list is created with
the `<dl>` element 



`<dt>`
the definition
term
`<dd>`
This is used to contain the
definition.


- Nested Lists

You can put a second list inside
an` <li>` element to create a sublist
or nested list.


## 2- Boxes

- each HTML element  has its own box and You can  control the dimensions of a box.

And control the borders, margin and padding
for each box 

**Every box has three available properties that
can be adjusted to control its appearance:**

1- **Border**

Every box has a border (even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border
separates the edge of one box
from another.


2- **Margin**

Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.

3-**Padding**

Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.
Adding padding can increase the
readability of its contents.



- You can  hide elements by using the display and
visibility properties.



-  Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
-  Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
-  CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.



## 3- JavaScript 

**Instructions**

* A script:  is a series of instructions .
* A statment: Each individual instruction or step and should end with a semicolon.
* A comments:  explain what your code does.
* A variables: temporarily store of information
   HOW to Declare 

` VAR  QUANTITY;`

  
   How to assign 



    `QUANTITY = 3 ;


* Arrays : special types of variables it stores a list of values.

* An expression: evaluates into (results in) a single value

**SWITCH STATEMENTS**


A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value.


* You have a default option that is run if
none of the cases match.

* If a match is found, that code is run; then
the break statement stops the rest of
the switch statement running (providing
better performance than multiple i f
statements).
